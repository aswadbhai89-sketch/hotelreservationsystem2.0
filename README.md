## 📖 About

This project is a **Hotel Reservation System** developed in **C++** 
as a Complex Computing Activity (CCA) for the Object-Oriented 
Programming course. The system simulates real-world hotel operations 
including guest management, room booking, billing, and administrative 
control with full data persistence across sessions.

The system demonstrates the following OOP concepts practically:
- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
- Composition, Aggregation, Friend Functions
- Operator Overloading, File Handling, Exception Handling, STL

## 🧠 OOP Concepts

### Core OOP (5 Credits)

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Encapsulation** | All attributes private/protected with public getters and setters. Password has no getter for security. |
| **Inheritance** | Person → Admin, Guest (Single). Room → SingleRoom, DoubleRoom, SuiteRoom (Hierarchical) |
| **Runtime Polymorphism** | displayInfo() virtual in Person, overridden in Admin and Guest. displayRoomInfo() virtual in Room, overridden in all room types |
| **Abstraction** | Person and Room are abstract classes with pure virtual functions. Cannot be instantiated directly |
| **Composition** | HotelSystem owns Admin, FileManager, and Records as member objects |
| **Aggregation** | HotelSystem has arrays of Guest, Rooms, Booking, Billing, Rules |
| **Friend Functions** | generateFinalBill() accesses private data of both Booking and Billing |
| **Constructors** | Default and Parameterized constructors in all 14 classes |
| **Destructors** | Virtual destructors with static counter management |

### Additional Requirements (5 Credits)

| Feature | Marks | Status | Implementation |
|---------|-------|--------|---------------|
| File Handling | 1 | ✅ Done | 5 text files for persistent storage |
| Exception Handling | 1 | ✅ Done | Custom HotelException class |
| STL Usage | 1 | ✅ Done | vector<string> in Records class |
| GUI Implementation | 1 | ⬜ Future | Console-based currently |
| Database Connectivity | 1 | ⬜ Future | Text files used currently |
